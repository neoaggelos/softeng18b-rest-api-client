# softeng18b-rest-api-client
A Java/Groovy client for the Online Price Observatory REST API

The client is fully operational and demonstrates the use of:

* The [Apache Http Components fluent client API](https://hc.apache.org/) for performing HTTP requests.
* The [Wire Mock](https://hc.apache.org/) library for mocking the responses of HTTP requests.
* The [Spock](http://spockframework.org/) framework for writing clean, declarative, maintainable test specifications.


The client can be embedded in any Java / Groovy application and it is developed for helping perform the functional / integration
tests of the Observatory back-end. See the test of [https://github.com/saikos/softeng18b](https://github.com/saikos/softeng18b)
